Users can add, edit, remove, and archive notes. 
 
A list of notes is displayed in a form of table. 
The columns are time of creation, note content, note category, and a list of dates mentioned in this note.

Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.
