# notesJS
A notes app in JS as a web app. 
Users can add, edit, remove, and archive notes. 
 
A list of notes is displayed in a form of table. 
The columns are time of creation, note content, note category, and a list of dates mentioned in this note. 

Users can archive notes. 
Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.

There is also a summary table that counts notes by categories: separately for active and archived. 
The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. 
The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.
